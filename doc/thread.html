<H3><A NAME="M4">DESCRIPTION</A></H3>
The
<b>thread</b>
extension creates threads that contain Tcl interpreters, and it lets you
send scripts to those threads.
<p>
<b>thread::create</b> creates a thread that contains a Tcl interpreter.
The Tcl interpreter either evaluates the <i>script</i>, if specified,
or it waits in the event loop for scripts that arrive via the
<b>thread::send</b> command.
The result of <b>thread::create</b> is the ID of the thread.
The result, if any, of <i>script</i> is ignored. Using flag
<b>-joinable</b> it is possible to create a joinable thread, i.e. one
upon whose exit can be waited upon (by using <b>thread::join</b>).
<p>
<b>thread::id</b> returns the ID of the current thread.
<p>
<b>thread::errorproc</b> sets a handler for errors that occur in other
threads. Or, if no procedure is specified, the current handler is returned.
By default, an uncaught error in a thread terminates that thread
and causes an error message to be sent to the standard error channel.
You can change the default reporting scheme by registering a procedure
that is called to report the error.
The <i>proc</i> is called in the interpreter that invoked the
<b>thread::errorproc</b> command.  The original thread that has the
uncaught error is terminated in any case.
The <i>proc</i> is called like this:
<ul>
<pre>
myerrorproc thread_id errorInfo
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
<b>thread::exit</b> terminates the current thread.
There is no way to force another thread to exit - you can only
ask it to terminate by sending it a command.
<p>
<b>thread::names</b> returns a list of thread IDs.
These are only for threads that have been created via <b>thread::create</b>.
If your application creates other threads at the C level, they
are not reported by <b>thread::names</b>.
<p>
<b>thread::exists</b> returns true (1) if thread given by the ID parameter
exists, false (0) otherwise. This applies only for threads that have been
created via <b>thread::create</b>.
<p>
<b>thread::send</b> passes a <i>script</i> to another thread and,
optionally, waits for the result.  If the <b>-async</b> flag is specified
then the caller does not wait for the result.  The target thread must
enter its event loop in order to receive script messages.  This is done
by default for threads created without a startup script.  Threads can
enter the event loop explicitly by calling 
<b>thread::wait</b> or <b>vwait</b>.
<p>
<b>thread::wait</b> enters the event loop so a thread can receive
messages from <b>thread::send</b>.  This is equivalent to
<b>vwait</b> <i>unusedvariable</i>.
<p>
<b>thread::join</b> waits for the thread with id <i>id</i> to exit and
then returns its exit code. Errors will be returned for threads which
are not joinable or already waited upon by another thread.
<p>
<b>thread::transfer</b> moves the specified <i>channel</i> from the
current thread and interpreter to the main interpreter of the thread
with the given <i>id</i>. After the move the current interpreter has
no access to the channel anymore, but the main interpreter of the
target thread will be able to use it from now on.

<H3><A NAME="M4">DISCUSSION</A></H3>

The fundamental threading model in Tcl
is that there can be one or more Tcl interpreters per thread, but
each Tcl interpreter should only be used by a single thread.
A "shared memory" abstraction is awkward to provide in Tcl because
Tcl makes assumptions about variable and data ownership.
Therefore this extension supports a simple form of threading where
the main thread can manage several background, or "worker" threads.
For example, an event-driven server can pass requests to worker threads,
and then await responses from worker threads or new client requests.
Everything goes through the common Tcl event loop, so message
passing between threads works naturally with event-driven I/O,
<b>vwait</b> on variables, and so forth. For the transfer of bulk
information it is possible to move channels between the threads.
